define a function, that tajes in exactly 1 string as an argument or parameter.

within the function, use the log() function of the console object to print out w.e parameter or argument happened to be passed in, but in all caps

finally the function will RETURN that same string, but this time in exactly the same format as it was originally passed in

function output(str) {
  console.log(str.toUpperCase);
  return str
